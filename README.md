This project is a three-page microsite for an upcoming multi day event. 

The site should work as an introduction to the event, where potential attendees can come and get an overview of the event. There will be a main homepage where the lineup/schedule and an overview will be displayed. With links to specific artists and purchase page/tickets.
There also will be profile page. This profile page will give an outline of a specific artist or performer. This page will need to have the artist's name and bio, along with some images of them.
A purchase page is also required. This page will function as a portal where an attendee can purchase any of the ticket options. The page must have a form where the attendee can enter their name, address, phone number and email address. All of the ticket options will be displayed and have a way to choose a specific ticket. 

This page will not be functional, just visually accessible.
